 * to manually emit schema snapshots to support detection of schema changes
 * from `ALTER PUBLICATION` commands on supabase, which does not fire event
 * triggers for them (https://github.com/supabase/supautils/issues/123).
 *
 * The hook is exercised by bookmarking the publication change with
 * `COMMENT ON PUBLICATION` statements within e.g.
 *
 * ```sql
 * BEGIN;
 * COMMENT ON PUBLICATION my_publication IS 'whatever';
 * ALTER PUBLICATION my_publication ...;
 * COMMENT ON PUBLICATION my_publication IS 'whatever';
 * COMMIT;
 * ```
 *
 * The `change-source` will perform the diff between a `schemaSnapshot`
 * events and its preceding `schemaSnapshot` (or `ddlUpdate`) within the
 * transaction.
 *
 * In the case where event trigger support is missing, this results in
 * diffing the `schemaSnapshot`s before and after the `ALTER PUBLICATION`
 * statement, thus effecting the same logic that would have been exercised
 * between the `ddlStart` and `ddlEvent` events fired by a database with
 * fully functional event triggers.
 *
 * Note that if the same transaction is run on a database that *does*
 * support event triggers on `ALTER PUBLICATION` statements, the sequence
 * of emitted messages will be:
 *
 * * `schemaSnapshot`
 * * `ddlStart`
 * * `ddlUpdate`
 * * `schemaSnapshot`
 *
 * Since `schemaSnapshot` messages are diffed with the preceding
 * `schemaSnapshot` or `ddlUpdate` event (if any), there will be no schema
 * difference between the `ddlUpdate` and the second `schemaSnapshot`, and
 * thus the extra `COMMENT` statements will effectively be no-ops.

 * unused versions, etc. (not unlike versioning of npm packages).

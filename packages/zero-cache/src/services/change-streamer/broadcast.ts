  /**
   * Checks for pathological situations in which flow should be reenabled
   * before all subscribers have acked.
   *
   * ### Background
   *
   * The purpose of flow control is to pull upstream replication changes
   * no faster than the rate as they are processed by downstream subscribers
   * in the steady state. In the change-streamer, this is done by occasionally
   * waiting for ACKs from subscribers before continuing; without doing so,
   * I/O buffers fill up and cause the system to spend most of its time in GC.
   *
   * However, the naive algorithm of always waiting for all subscribers (e.g.
   * `Promise.all()`) can behave poorly in scenarios where subscribers
   * are imbalanced:
   * * New subscribers may have a backlog of changes to catch up with.
   *   Having all subscribers wait for the new subscriber to catch up results
   *   in delaying the entire application.
   * * Broken TCP connections similarly require all subscribers to wait until
   *   connection liveness checks kick in and disconnect the subscriber.
   *
   * A simplistic approach is to add a limit to the amount of time waiting for
   * subscribers, i.e. an ack timeout. However, deciding what this timeout
   * should be is non-trivial because of the heterogeneous nature of changes;
   * while most changes operate on single rows and are relatively predictable
   * in terms of running time, some changes are table-wide operations and can
   * legitimately take an arbitrary amount of time. In such scenarios, a
   * timeout that is too short can stop progress on replication altogether.
   *
   * ### Consensus-based Timeout Algorithm
   *
   * To address these shortcomings, a "consensus-based timeout" algorithm is
   * used:
   * * Wait for more than half of the subscribers to finish. (In
   *   case of a single node, or the case of one replication-manager
   *   and one view-syncer, this reduces to waiting for all subscribers.)
   * * Once more than half of the subscribers have finished, proceed after
   *   a fixed timeout elapses (e.g. 1 second), even if not all subscribers
   *   have finished.
   *
   * In other words, the subscribers themselves are used to determine the
   * timeout of each batch of changes; the majority determines this when
   * they complete, upon which a timeout is logically started.
   *
   * In the common case, the remaining subscribers finish soon afterward and
   * the timeout never elapses. However, in pathological cases where a minority
   * of subscribers have a disproportionate amount of load, some will still
   * be processing (or otherwise unresponsive). These subscribers are given
   * a bounded amount of time to catch up at each flushed batch, up to the
   * timeout interval. This guarantees eventual catchup because the
   * subscribers with a backlog of changes necessarily have a higher
   * processing rate than the subscribers that finished (and are made to wait).
   *
   * ### Not implemented: Broken connection detection
   *
   * If a subscriber has not made progress for a certain interval, the
   * algorithm could theoretically drop it preemptively, supplementing the
   * existing websocket-level liveness checks.
   *
   * However, a more reliable approach would be to change the replicator
   * to use non-blocking writes, and subsequently increase the frequency of
   * connection-level liveness checks. The current synchronous replica writes
   * can delay both ping responsiveness and change progress arbitrarily (e.g.
   * a large index creation); an independently liveness check that is not
   * delayed by synchronous writes on the subscriber would be a more failsafe
   * solution.
   *
   * @returns `true` if the broadcast was already done or was marked done.
